Solution

- Sliding window: O(nlogn) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        newNums = sorted(set(nums)) # all duplicated elements must be replaced, so we first get rid of them directly
        ans = n
        right = 0
        for left in range(len(newNums)):
            # for every left, we find the rightmost position `right` that elements in window [left, right] can form a continuous array
            while right < len(newNums) and newNums[right] <= newNums[left] + n - 1:
                right += 1
            curLength = right - left
            ans = min(ans, n - curLength) # all the elements that are not in current window should be replaced
        return ans
```
