class Solution:
    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:
        # Consider this as a knapsack problem: Given a list of numbers, multiply each number with 1 or 0 or -1, make the sum of all numbers to 0. Find a combination which has the largest sum of all positive numbers.
        dp = {0: 0} # We use dp to store 'current total sum: the maximum of current positive number sum given current total sum'.
        for r in rods:
            # For each element r in rods, we has three options: add 1 * r, -1 * r or 0 * r
            cur = {}
            for k in dp:
                cur[k + r] = max(cur.get(k + r, 0), dp[k] + r)
                cur[k] = max(cur.get(k, 0), dp[k])
                cur[k - r] = max(cur.get(k - r, 0), dp[k])
            dp = cur
        return dp[0]
