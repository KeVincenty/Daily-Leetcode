# 1. Given an `m x n` 2D matrix `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands in `grid`. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

Solution

- DFS: O(nm) & S(nm) if not modify the input else S(1)

Code

- Java (Modify the input)

```java

```

- Python (Not modify the input)

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        res = 0
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == '1' and not visited[row][col]:
                    res += 1
                    self.dfs(grid, visited, row, col, m, n)
        return res
        
    def dfs(self, grid, visited, row, col, m, n):
        # use dfs to visit all the elements that are connected with grid[row][col]
        if row < 0 or row >= m or col < 0 or col >= n or grid[row][col] == '0' or visited[row][col]:
            return
        visited[row][col] = True 
        self.dfs(grid, visited, row - 1, col, m, n)
        self.dfs(grid, visited, row + 1, col, m, n)
        self.dfs(grid, visited, row, col - 1, m, n)
        self.dfs(grid, visited, row, col + 1, m, n)
