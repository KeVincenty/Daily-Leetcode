- Python (a more concise version)

```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfDistancesInTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:

        subtree = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        res = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        # build graph
        for a, b in edges:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)

        def dfs1(node, parent):
            # recursively compute the number of nodes in the subtree whose root is node, and the connection between node-parent is cut; and compute res[0] at the same time
            for child in graph[node]:
                if child != parent:
                    dfs1(child, node)
                    subtree[node] += subtree[child]
                    res[node] += res[child] + subtree[child]

        def dfs2(node, parent):
            # compute res for other nodes
            for child in graph[node]:
                if child != parent:
                    res[child] = res[node] + (n - subtree[child]) - subtree[child]
                    dfs2(child, node)

        dfs1(0, -1)
        dfs2(0, -1)
        
        return res
