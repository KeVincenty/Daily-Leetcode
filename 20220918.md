# 1. Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Solution

- Two pointers: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        maxLeft, maxRight, res = 0, 0, 0

        while left <= right:
            # if height of the left pointer is lower than that of the right pointer, then we might find a wall to the left of the left pointer to fill in the water
            if height[left] <= height[right]:
                # if the current height is not higher than the highest wall to its left, then we could not fill in any water
                if height[left] >= maxLeft:
                    maxLeft = height[left]
                # else, we can fill in some water
                else:
                    res += maxLeft - height[left]
                left += 1
            # same to the right pointer
            else:
                if height[right] >= maxRight:
                    maxRight = height[right]
                else:
                    res += maxRight - height[right]
                right -= 1

        return res
