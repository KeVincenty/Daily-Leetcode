class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = {}
        for n in nums:
            freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        minimum, maximum = min(nums), max(nums)
        dp = [0 for _ in range(maximum+2)] # dp[i] is the maximum points we can get when i is the minimum number in the current subset of nums
        dp[maximum] = freq[maximum] * maximum
        for i in range(maximum-1, minimum-1, -1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], freq.get(i, 0) * i + dp[i+2])
        return dp[minimum]
