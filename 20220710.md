# 2. Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/ 剑指offer 56.1

Solution

- Bit manipulation. Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/, but now we have 2 unique integers in this array. So first, we divide the array into two halves, each one has exactly one unique integer. We use the first bit that is different in these 2 integers to assign elements in the array to different halves: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        diff = 0
        for num in nums:
            diff = diff ^ num
        diffidx = self.findFirst1Bit(diff)
        res1 = 0
        res2 = 0
        for num in nums:
            if self.check1Bit(num, diffidx):
                res1 = res1 ^ num
            else:
                res2 = res2 ^ num
        return [res1, res2]
            
    def findFirst1Bit(self, diff:int) -> int:
        # find the first 1-bit in diff and return the index
        diffidx = 0
        while diff & 1 == 0:
            diff = diff >> 1
            diffidx += 1
        return diffidx

    def check1Bit(self, num, diffidx) -> bool:
        # check if num's diffidx-th bit is 1
        tmp = num >> diffidx
        return tmp & 1 == 1
```

# 3. Given an integer array where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/ 剑指offer 56.2

Solution

- Use an array to count the number of '1' appears at each bit. Then the '1's in single element are at the position where the counter is 3n+1: O(n) & S(1)
- State transition. If K = 2, we can directly use XOR because for every bit, after XOR 2x times by the same elements, it becomes the original value (e.g. n ^ 1 ^ 1 = n).; If K = 3, we need another operation that, after apply it 3x time by the same elements, it becomes the original value (e.g. we use @ to note this operation, n @ 1 @ 1 @ 1 = n). This can be achieved using the idea of digital circuit design. There are 3 states so we use 2 bits (ab) the 3 states transit if input is '1' as follows: 00 -> 10 -> 01 -> 00 -> .... So the state transition functions are a = a ^ input & \~b, b = b ^ input & \~a: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java (Array)

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int[] bit = new int[32];
        int res = 0;
        for (int num: nums) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
                bit[i] += (num >> i) & 1;
            }
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
            if (bit[j] % 3 != 0) {
                res |= 1 << j;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Python (State transition)

```python
    class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for num in nums:
            a = a ^ num & ~b
            b = b ^ num & ~a
        return a
```

    We can generalize the solution above to any K.
