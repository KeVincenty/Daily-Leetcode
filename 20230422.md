# 1. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome

Solution

- DP : O(n^2) & S(n^2)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minInsertions(self, s: str) -> int:
        # the idea is: if the length of the longest subsequence which is a palindrome is x, then we only have to deal with the remaining (n-x) characters. and these (n-x) characters will always need (n-x) insertion to make them palindrome. so this problem is equivalent to find the longest palindrome subsequence in s
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] # dp[i][j] equals to the maximum length of palindrome subsequnce in s[i:j+1]
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        return n - dp[0][n-1]
