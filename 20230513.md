        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        dp = [0 for _ in range(high + 1)] # dp[i] is the number of different good strings with length of i
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, high + 1):
            if i - zero >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i - zero]
            if i - one >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i - one]
            dp[i] %= MOD
        return sum(dp[low:high + 1]) % MOD
