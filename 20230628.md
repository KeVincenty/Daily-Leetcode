# 1. Task Scheduler https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler

Solution

- Greedy / Queue : O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java (Greedy)

```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        // Think this problem from the perspective of the most frequent task, there are two situations: 1) The minimum idle (n) between the most frequent task is not enough to hold all other tasks. In this case, the answer should just be the number of tasks; 2) The minimum idle is enough to hold all other tasks. In this case, assume there are m unique most frequent tasks and their frequencies are f, then the answer would be (n+1) * (f-1) + m. It is not necessary for us to decide which situation we are in, we just need to take the maximum of these two situations as our answer.
        int[] counter = new int[26];
        for (char t : tasks) {
            counter[t - 'A']++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(counter); // sort a fixed length (26) array would be O
        int maxFreq = counter[25];
        int numMaxFreq = 0;
        int i = 25;
        while (i >= 0 && counter[i] == maxFreq) {
            numMaxFreq++;
            i--;
        }
        return Math.max(tasks.length, (n + 1) * (maxFreq - 1) + numMaxFreq);
    }
}
```

- Python (Queue)

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        count = Counter(tasks)
        freq = sorted(count.values(), reverse = True)
        jobs = deque([(t + 1, f) for t, f in enumerate(freq)])
        time = 0
        while len(jobs) > 0:
            time += 1
            if time < jobs[0][0]:
                continue
            curTime, curFreq = jobs.popleft()
            if curFreq > 1:
                jobs.append((curTime + n + 1, curFreq - 1))
        return time
