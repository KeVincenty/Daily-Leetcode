# 1. Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

Solution

- Binary search. We can cut the 2 arrays into 2 halves respectively. We are searching for such cut so that: 1) the 2 left-halves have the same number of elements as the 2 right-halves; 2) all the elements in the 2 left-halves are smaller than those in the 2 right-halves. Due to the restriction 1), if we find a cutting position for one array, then the cutting position for another array is immediately decided. And given the 2 arrays are sorted, we can use bianry search to find the cutting position in the shorter array: O(log(min(m,n))) & S(1)

        if m > n:
            return self.findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1)
        
        INT_MAX = 10**7
        INT_MIN = -10**7
        # there are actually 2*n+1 cutting positions for an array of length n, so the searching range is 0-2n
        start = 0
        end = 2*m 
        while start <= end:
            cut1 = (start + end) // 2
            cut2 = m + n - cut1
            L1 = INT_MIN if cut1 == 0 else nums1[(cut1-1)//2]
            R1 = INT_MAX if cut1 == 2*m else nums1[cut1//2]
            L2 = INT_MIN if cut2 == 0 else nums2[(cut2-1)//2]
            R2 = INT_MAX if cut2 == 2*n else nums2[cut2//2]
            if L1 <= R2 and L2 <= R1:
                break
            elif L2 > R1:
                start = cut1 + 1
            else:
                end = cut1 - 1
        return (max(L1, L2) + min(R1, R2))/2
