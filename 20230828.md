    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(costs)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(n+1)] # dp[i][j] is the minimum cost of painting costs[:i] houses given the current color is j. Can be optimized to S(1) implementation.
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i][0] = min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i-1][0]
            dp[i][1] = min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i-1][1]
