class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        '''
            an integer that is power of 4 should meet the following 3 conditions:
            1) greater than 0;
            2) has only one '1' digit in it; (can be checked by n & (n-1))
            3) the '1' digit is at the odd position; (can be checked by n & 0x55555555, where 0x55555555 is an integer with '1' at all odd positions)
        '''
        return n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0 and (n & 0x55555555) != 0
