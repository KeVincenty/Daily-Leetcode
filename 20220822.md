# 1. Given an integer `n`, check if it is a power of `4`. https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/

Solution

- Bit manipulation: O(1) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        '''
            an integer that is power of 4 should meet the following 3 conditions:
            1) greater than 0;
            2) has only one '1' digit in it; (can be checked by n & (n-1))
            3) the '1' digit is at the odd position; (can be checked by n & 0x55555555, where 0x55555555 is an integer with '1' at all odd positions)
        '''
        return n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0 and (n & 0x55555555) != 0
```

# 2. Given an integer `n`, check if it is a power of `3`. https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/

Solution

- ...

Code

- Java (Prime number)

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        // 3^19 = 1162261467, which is the biggest integer power of 3 smaller than 2^31-1  
        return (n > 0 && 1162261467 % n == 0);
    }
}
```

- Python (Recursion)

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 1:
            return True
        if n <= 0 or n % 3 != 0:
            return False
        else:
            return self.isPowerOfThree(n // 3)
