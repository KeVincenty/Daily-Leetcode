# 1. Find Eventual Safe States https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states

Solution

- DFS/BFS + Kahn's Algorithm : O(V+E) & S(V+E)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # This problem is equal to find all the nodes that are in a circle, and all the nodes left are the answer.
        # To achieve this, we start from the nodes that have no outgoing edge, and remove the edges between theses nodes and their parents. After this, if any parents now have no outgoing nodes, we traverse from them recursively. We implement this using Kahn's algorithm with a reversed version of the origin graph.
        n = len(graph)
        reversedGraph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        outdegree = [len(x) for x in graph]

        for i in range(n):
            if outdegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
            for neighbor in graph[i]:
                reversedGraph[neighbor].append(i)
        safeNodes = [False for _ in range(n)]
        while len(queue) > 0:
            cur = queue.popleft()

            for parent in reversedGraph[cur]:
                outdegree[parent] -= 1
