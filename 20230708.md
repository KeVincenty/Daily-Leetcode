# 1. Put Marbles in Bags https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags

Solution

- Greedy + Heap : O(nlogk) & S(k)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def putMarbles(self, weights: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # To distribute the marbles to k bags, we need k-1 partitions. Obeserve that: 1) regradless of the way we put the k-1 partitions, we will always have the leftmost and rightmost elements in our final scores; 2) everytime we put a partition at index i, the score increases weights[i] + weights[i+1]. So we only need to find the max-(k-1) and min-(k-1) (weights[i] + weights[i+1]), and their difference will be the anwser.
        n = len(weights)
        if k == 1 or k == n:
            return 0
        minHeap, maxHeap = [], []
        for i in range(n-1):
            cur = weights[i] + weights[i+1]
            if len(minHeap) < k - 1:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, -cur)
            elif cur < -minHeap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, -cur)
            if len(maxHeap) < k - 1:
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, cur)
            elif cur > maxHeap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, cur)
        diff = sum(maxHeap) + sum(minHeap)
        return diff
