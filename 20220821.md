# 1. Stamping The Sequence https://leetcode.com/problems/stamping-the-sequence/

Solution

- Greedy: O(length of stamp * length of target) & S(length of target)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def movesToStamp(self, stamp: str, target: str) -> List[int]:
        '''
            Take "abca" and "aabcaca" for example, in each turn, we scan the target to find if there is any substring match the stamp, if there is any, replace them with "*". In this case, we have: "aabcaca" -> "a****ca" ("abca" matches "abca") -> "*****ca" ("a***" matches "abca") -> "******" ("**ca" matches "abca"). Now that all the characters in this string is replaced by "*", we return the array of indices where we perform replacement in a reversed order (in this case [3, 0, 1]). And if we cannot replace at least 1 character in a scan, it means we cannot obtain target from stamp, so we return empty array.
