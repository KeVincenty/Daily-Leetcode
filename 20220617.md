# 1. Given a linked list, reverse k nodes of the list at a time https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

Solution

- Two pointers to find the start and the end of each group, then reverse the group: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        start = head
        end = head
        final = ListNode()
        dummy = final
        count = 0
        while end is not None and count < k:
            end = end.next
            count += 1
            if count >= k:
                cur = start
                prev = end
                for _ in range(k):
                    nxt = cur.next
                    cur.next = prev
                    prev = cur
                    cur = nxt
                final.next = prev 
                final = start # use final to record the end of the previous group
                start = end
                count = 0
        return dummy.next

# 2. Reorder a linked list as: [a0, an, a1, an-1, a2, an-2, ...] https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

Solution

- Cut the linked list from the middel; Reverse the second half; Merge them together: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```
