# 1. Given an integer array, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the maximum of every sliding window https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/ 剑指offer 59.1

Solution

- Use a **deque** to record indexes of good candidates. Make sure that: 1) the indexes in deque are in current sliding window; 2) the corresponding value of indexes is in decsending order. In this case, the top of deque is the maximum value in current sliding window: O(n) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        deque = []
        res = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if len(deque) == 0:
                deque.append(i)
            else:
                # if the top element is not in the current sliding window, delete it
                if i-deque[0] == k:
                    deque.pop(0)
                # delete all the bad candidates which are smaller than nums[i]
                while len(deque) > 0 and nums[i] > nums[deque[-1]]:
                    deque.pop()
                # push i into the deque
                deque.append(i)
            # if the window has reached size k, start to output
            if i >= k-1:
                res.append(nums[deque[0]])
        return res
```

# 2. Design a queue that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the maximum element in constant time https://leetcode.cn/problems/dui-lie-de-zui-da-zhi-lcof/ 剑指offer 59.2 

Solution

- Deque, similar to 1.: O(1) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class MaxQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = [] # use a queue to record data
        self.maximum = [] # use a deque to record the maximum

    def max_value(self) -> int:
        if len(self.queue) == 0:
            return -1
        else:
            return self.maximum[0]

    def push_back(self, value: int) -> None:
        self.queue.append(value)
        while len(self.maximum) > 0 and self.maximum[-1] < value:
            self.maximum.pop()
        self.maximum.append(value)

    def pop_front(self) -> int:
        if len(self.queue) == 0:
            return -1
        else:
            popped = self.queue.pop(0)
            if self.maximum[0] == popped:
                self.maximum.pop(0)
            return popped
