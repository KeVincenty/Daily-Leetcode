# 1. Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/

Solution

- Level order traverse: O(n) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        output = []
        if root is None:
            return output
        queue = [root]
        while len(queue) != 0:
            output.append(queue[-1].val)
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                popped = queue.pop(0)
                if popped.left is not None:
                    queue.append(popped.left)
                if popped.right is not None:
                    queue.append(popped.right)
        return output
```

# 2. Given a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/

Solution

- To delete a node in BST, there are 2 cases: 1) if the node has 0 or 1 child, then the node can be deleted as it is passed through (node = node.left/node.right); 2) if the node has 2 children, first we find the **smallest value of its right tree** or the **largest value of its left tree** (this is equal to find the **left most node of its right tree** or the **right most node of its left tree**), then let the node have this value, finally delete the **left most node of its right tree** or the **right most node of its left tree** recursively: O(height of the tree) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # search for the node to be removed
        if root is None:
            return None
        elif root.val < key:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        elif root.val > key:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        elif root.val == key:
            # delete the node
            if root.left is not None and root.right is not None:
                tmp = root.right
                while tmp.left is not None:
                    tmp = tmp.left
                root.val = tmp.val
                root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, tmp.val)
            elif root.left is None:
                root = root.right
            elif root.right is None:
                root = root.left
        return root
