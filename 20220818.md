```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = {}
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        # bucket sort the frequency
        freqBucket = [0 for _ in range(len(arr)+1)]
        for v in freq.values():
            freqBucket[v] += 1
        
        cur = 0
        res = 0
        index = len(freqBucket) - 1
        while cur < len(arr)//2 and index > 0:
            if freqBucket[index] > 0:
                cur += index
                res += 1
                freqBucket[index] -= 1
            else:
                index -= 1
