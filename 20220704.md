Code

- Java

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def permutation(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        char = list(s)
        self.perm(res, char, 0)
        return res

        # check all the conditions of index-th position
    def perm(self, res: List[str], char: List[str], index: int):
        # if the index-th positoin is the last position, then output
        if index == len(char) - 1:
            res.append(''.join(char))
        else:
            # traverse all the elements that are behind index-th position
            for i in range(index, len(char)):
                # a flag to prevent duplicated output
                dup = False
                for j in range(index, i):
                    # if there is any element in front of i-th position that is the same as the i-th element, then we can skip the i-th element, because we have already considered the conditions where the index-th position is the i-th elements in char before
                    if char[j] == char[i]:
                        dup = True
                if not dup:
                    # swap the i-th element with the index-th position, which means we are considering all the conditions where the index-th position is the i-th elements in char
                    self.swap(char, i, index)
                    # recursively check the (index+1)-th position
                    self.perm(res, char, index+1) 
                    # swap back so that char gets back to the origin
                    self.swap(char, i, index)

    def swap(self, char: List[str], i: int, j: int):
        # swap the i-th element and j-th element
        if i != j:
            tmp = char[i]
            char[i] = char[j]
            char[j] = tmp

# 2. Return the median from a data stream https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/ 剑指offer 41

Solution

- Array: add -> O(1); find the median -> O(n)
- Sorted array: add -> O(n); find the median -> O(1)
- Sorted linked list: add -> O(n); find the median -> O(1)
- Binary search tree: add -> O(height of the tree); find the median -> O(height of the tree)
- AVL tree: add -> O(logn); find the median -> O(1)
- Split the data into two half, where all the elements in the left half is smaller than those in the right half. Then the median is decided (depends on the total number of data is even/odd) by the maximum of the left half and the minimum of the right half. Use a max heap to record the left half and a min heap to record the right half: add -> O(logn); find the median -> O(1)

Code

- Java (Two heaps)

```java

```

- Python (Two heaps)

```python
class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        self.minheap = []
        self.maxheap = []
        self.total = 0

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if self.total & 1 == 0:
            if len(self.minheap) > 0 and num > self.minheap[0]:
                minpop = heapq.heappop(self.minheap)
                heapq.heappush(self.maxheap, -minpop)
                heapq.heappush(self.minheap, num)
            else:
                heapq.heappush(self.maxheap, -num)
        else:
            if len(self.maxheap) > 0 and num < -self.maxheap[0]:
                maxpop = heapq.heappop(self.maxheap)
                heapq.heappush(self.maxheap, -num)
                heapq.heappush(self.minheap, -maxpop)
            else:
                heapq.heappush(self.minheap, num)
        self.total += 1

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if self.total & 1 == 0:
            return (self.minheap[0] - self.maxheap[0]) / 2.
        else:
            return -self.maxheap[0]
```

Follow up

- If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?

We can maintain an integer array of length 100 to store the count of each number along with a total count. Then, we can iterate over the array to find the middle value to get our median: add -> O(1); find the median -> O(1)

- If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?

In this case, we need 2 addition arrays to record the numbers < 0 and the numbers > 100.
