- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf') for _ in range(n+1)] # dp[i] is the minimum number of taps needed to water 0-i
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(n+1):
            left, right = max(0, i - ranges[i]), min(n, i + ranges[i])
            for j in range(left, right+1):
                dp[right] = min(dp[right], dp[j] + 1)
        return -1 if dp[n] == float('inf') else dp[n]
