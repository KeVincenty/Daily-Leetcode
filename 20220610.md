# 1. Return the minimum number of intervals needed to be removed so that the others are non-overlapping https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

Solution

- Sort by the start and then sort by the end, remove intervals that overlap with the former one

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals)
        cur = sorted_intervals[0]
        count = 1
        for i in range(len(sorted_intervals)):
            if sorted_intervals[i][0] < cur[1]:
                cur[1] = min(sorted_intervals[i][1], cur[1])
            else:
                cur[1] = max(sorted_intervals[i][1], cur[1])
                count += 1
        return len(sorted_intervals)-count
```

# 2. Given an integer array `num`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` equals to the product of all elements of the input array except `num[i]` https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Solution

- Each element in the output array is determined by all the elements to its left and all the elements to its right. So iterate both from left and from right: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        output = [1 for i in range(len(nums))]
        left = 1
        right = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            output[i] = output[i] * left
            left = left * nums[i]
        for j in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
            output[j] = output[j] * right
            right = right * nums[j]
        return output
```

# 3. Given an integer array, return the total number of **contiguous** subarrays whose sum equals to target https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/

Solution

- Since we are finding **contiguous** subarray and sum(i,j) = sum(0,j) - sum(0,i), we only need to traverse the array once to record sum(0,x): O(n) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        cursum = 0
        count = 0
        sum_dict = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            cursum += nums[i]
            if cursum == k:
                count += 1
            count += sum_dict.get(cursum-k, 0)
            sum_dict[cursum] = sum_dict.get(cursum, 0) + 1
        return count
```
