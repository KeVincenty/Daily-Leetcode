        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(n)] # dp[i][k][0/1] is the maximum profit we can make on i-th day with k transactions and currently holding 0/1 stock. Can be optimized to S(1)
        dp[0][1][1], dp[0][2][1] = -prices[0], float('-inf')
