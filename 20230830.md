# 1. Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-replacements-to-sort-the-array

Solution

- Greedy: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumReplacement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Greedy: The last element does not need to be replaced. So we start from the second last element. We need to split the second last element: 1) as evenly as possible; 2) as close to the last element as possible. After we finish splitting, we find the new "last element" and "second last element" and continue splitting iteratively.
        ans = 0
        last = nums[-1]
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            if nums[i] > last:
                step = math.ceil(nums[i]/last)
                last = nums[i] // step
                ans += step - 1
            else:
                last = nums[i]
        return ans
