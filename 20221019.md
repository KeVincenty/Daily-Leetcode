# 1. Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings. https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

Solution

- Min heap: O(nlogk) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class ReverseWordOrder:
    def __init__(self, word):
        self.word = word
    
    def __lt__(self, other):
        # guaranteed no equality since we are comparing keys in counter
        # flipping the lesser than comparator for our purpose to keep greater word in heap
        return self.word > other.word

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        freq = {}
        for w in words:
            freq[w] = freq.get(w, 0) + 1
        minheap = []
        for key, val in freq.items():
            heapq.heappush(minheap, (val, ReverseWordOrder(key)))
            if len(minheap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(minheap)
        res = [None for _ in range(k)]
        for i in range(k):
            res[k-i-1] = heapq.heappop(minheap)[1].word
        return res
