# 1. You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/ 

Solution

- Two pointers. 

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        maximum = 0
        while left < right:
            hleft = height[left]
            hright = height[right]
            cur = (right - left) * min(hleft, hright)
            if cur > maximum:
                maximum = cur
            if hleft <= hright:
                while left < right and height[left] <= hleft: # this line helps to skip some elements, but it is not necessary
                    left += 1
            else:
                while left < right and height[right] <= hright: # same as above
                    right -= 1
        return maximum
