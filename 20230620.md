# 1. Car Fleet https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/

Solution

- Sort + Monotonic Stack : O(nlogn) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python 1 (S(1) Without an explicit stack)

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        cars = [(target - x[0]) / x[1] for x in sorted(zip(position, speed))] # sort the cars by their positions and directly calculate the time needed for each car to reach target
        n = len(cars)
        res = 0
        prevFleet = 0
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if cars[i] > prevFleet:
                # if a car cannot chase the car/fleet in the front, then this car will become a new fleet
                prevFleet = cars[i]
                res += 1
        return res
```

- Python 2 (S(n) With an explicit stack)

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        cars = sorted([x for x in zip(position, speed)]) # sort the cars by their positions
        n = len(cars)
        for i in range(n):
            while len(stack) > 0 and (target - stack[-1][0]) / stack[-1][1] <= (target - cars[i][0]) / cars[i][1]:
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(cars[i]) # if a car can be chased by another car behind, this car can be kept unchanged and we remove the faster car in the stack
        return len(stack)
```
