- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minScore(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # this problems is equivalent to finding the node with minimum edge connected to 1
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b, d in roads:
            graph[a].append((b, d))
            graph[b].append((a, d))
        visited = {1}
        queue = deque([1])
        ans = float('inf')
        while len(queue) > 0:
            curNode = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor, distance in graph[curNode]:
                ans = min(ans, distance)
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
