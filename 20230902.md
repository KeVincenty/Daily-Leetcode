class Solution:
    def minExtraChar(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        dictionarySet = set(dictionary)
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)] # dp[i] is the minimum number of extra characters left over if we break up s[:i] optimally
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
            for j in range(i):
                if s[j:i] in dictionarySet:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j])
        return dp[n]
