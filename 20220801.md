# 1. There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner. https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/

Solution

- DP: O(mn) & S(n)

Code

- Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[] res = new int[n];
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
                if (row == 0 || col == 0) {
                    res[col] = 1;
                }
                else {
                    res[col] += res[col-1];
                }
            }
        }
        return res[n-1];
    }
}
```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        res = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        for row in range(1, m):
            for col in range(1, n):
                res[col] += res[col-1]
        return res[n-1]
