# 1. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards

Solution

- Sliding window: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # The sum of the whole array is fixed, and we can only pick cards from both edges of the array. So the problem is equivalent to finding a n-k long sliding window with minimum sum
        n = len(cardPoints)
        curSum = sum(cardPoints[:n-k])
        minSum = curSum
        for i in range(k):
            curSum += cardPoints[i+n-k] - cardPoints[i]
            minSum = min(minSum, curSum)
        return sum(cardPoints) - minSum
```
