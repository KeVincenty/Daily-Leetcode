# 1. Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where: `'.'` matches any single character; `'*'` matches zero or more of the preceding element https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/ 剑指offer 19

Solution

- Non-deterministic finite state machine, recursively or DP

Code

- Java (DP)

```java

```

- Python (Recursively)

```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        if p == '':
            return s == ''
        elif len(p) > 1 and p[1] == '*': # if the 2nd char is '*', we have to choose to stay ot move to the next state
            if len(s) > 0 and (s[0] == p[0] or p[0] == '.'): # if the 1st char matches
                # we have 3 choices: 1) move one char forward for s and stay in the same state for p; 2) stay for s and move to the next state for p; 3) move one char forward for s and move to the next state of p (this actually is included by the previous two conditions) 
                return self.isMatch(s[1:], p) or self.isMatch(s, p[2:])
            else: # if the 1st char does not match
                # stay for s and move to the next state for p
                return self.isMatch(s, p[2:])
        else:
            if len(s) > 0 and (s[0] == p[0] or p[0] == '.'): # if the 2nd char is not '*', and the 1st char matches
                # move one char forward for s and move to the next state for p
                return self.isMatch(s[1:], p[1:])
            else:
                return False

# 2. Given an integer array, exchange the integers in it so that the odd numbers are in the front and the even numbers are in the end https://leetcode.cn/problems/diao-zheng-shu-zu-shun-xu-shi-qi-shu-wei-yu-ou-shu-qian-mian-lcof/ 剑指offer 21

Solution

- Two pointers: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def exchange(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return nums
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            while left < right and nums[left] & 1 == 1:
                left += 1

            while left < right and nums[right] & 1 == 0:
                right -= 1
            
            if left < right:
                nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        return nums
```
