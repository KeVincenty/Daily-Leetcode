    def minimumEffortPath(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        if m == n == 1:
            return 0

- Python(Dijkstra with Heap)

```python

        ans = 0
        queue = [(0, (0, 0))] # (curEffort, (curRow, curCol))
        visited = set()
        while len(queue) > 0:
            curEffort, (curRow, curCol) = heapq.heappop(queue)
            ans = max(curEffort, ans)
            if (curRow, curCol) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((curRow, curCol))
