# 1. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range

Solution

- Bit manipulation

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # Imagine the distribution of 0s and 1s of integers in a range. There are 'a lot of' difference, and we are doing "bitwise AND"... So this problem is equivalent to that we find the common prefix of left and right
        bitMove = 0
        while left != right:
            left >>= 1
            right >>= 1
            bitMove += 1
        return left << bitMove
```
