# 1. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c

Solution

- Bit manipulation 

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        # We need to flip some bits of a or b when a | b is different from c, the opperation to detect bit difference is XOR. So (a | b) ^ c gives us the number of different bits. And only when c == 0 and a == 1 and b == 1 should we do 2 flips, otherwise we just need 1 flip. a & b & (a | b) ^ c gives us the number of 2-flips we need to do. Therefore, the final answer should be the number of "1"s in (a | b) ^ c and a & b & (a | b) ^ c
        return bin((a | b) ^ c).count('1') + bin((a & b & ((a | b) ^ c))).count('1')
```
