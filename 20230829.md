        n = len(customers)
        nFreq, yFreq = [0 for _ in range(n+1)], [0 for _ in range(n+1)] # count the number of 'N' in customers[:i] and the number of 'Y' in customers[i:]

- Python (1 pass)

```python
class Solution:
    def bestClosingTime(self, customers: str) -> int:
        #  The number of 'Y' and 'N' in the input array is fixed, which means that adding one 'Y' to the open hour is equivalent to decreasing one 'Y' from the close hour, vice versa. So we only need to calculate the difference between the number of 'Y' and 'N' until now.
        n = len(customers)
