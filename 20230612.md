```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
        if len(s) > len(t):
            return False
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1
        return i == len(s)

- Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 10^9, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Use a nested list/dict to record the indices of every character in t, then use binary search to find the index of corresponding character in s

```python 
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        tChar = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, char in enumerate(t):
            tChar[char].append(idx)
        prev = 0
        for c in s:
            if c not in tChar:
                return False
            cur = bisect.bisect_left(tChar[c], prev)
            if cur == len(tChar[c]):
                return False
            prev = tChar[c][cur] + 1
        return True
```
