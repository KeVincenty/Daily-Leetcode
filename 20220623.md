# 1. In n people, there is one judge that everybody trust and trust nobody, find the judge https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge

Solution

- In a directed graph, use two lists to store the indegree and outdegree of every node and find the node with 0 outdegree and n-1 indegree: O(number of nodes + number of edges) & S(number of nodes)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        indegree = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        outdegree = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(len(trust)):
            outdegree[trust[i][0]-1] += 1
            indegree[trust[i][1]-1] += 1
        for j in range(n):
            if indegree[j] == n-1 and outdegree[j] == 0:
                return j+1
        return -1
```

# 2. Given a directed acyclic graph, find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/

Solution

- In a directed acyclic graph, the nodes with 0 indegree are not reachable from other nodes, and the nodes with >0 indegree are reachable from other nodes. So the smallest set is the set of all nodes with 0 indegree: O(number of nodes) & S(number of nodes)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestSetOfVertices(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        indegree = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        for edge in edges:
            indegree[edge[1]] += 1
        for i in range(len(indegree)):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                res.append(i)
        return res
```

# 3. Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited `room i`, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/

Solution

- DFS: O(number of nodes + number of edges) & S(number of nodes + number of edges)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        stack = []
        visited = set()
        visited.add(0)
        stack += rooms[0]
        while len(stack) != 0:
            popped = stack.pop()
            if popped not in visited:
                visited.add(popped)
                stack += rooms[popped]
                
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)
```
