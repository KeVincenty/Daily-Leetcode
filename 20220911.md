        # sort engineers by their efficiency in descending order
        effAndSpeed = sorted([(efficiency[i], speed[i]) for i in range(n)], key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
        
        # init a heap to store k highest speed
        heap = []
        curSpeed = 0
        res = 0
        
        for eff, speed in effAndSpeed:
