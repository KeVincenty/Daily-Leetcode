# 1. You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip. Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus. You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips. https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/

Solution

- Binary search: O(mlogn) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        # calculate the upper bound of time
        min_time = time[0]
        for t in time:
            min_time = min(t, min_time)
        right = totalTrips*min_time
        # binary search the minimum time in which at most totalTrips trips can be completed
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # calculate the number of trips at most can be completed using mid time
            num = 0
            for t in time:
                num += mid//t
            if num >= totalTrips:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

# 2. You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the i-th server to serve one customer. There are `m` servers in total. Each server can serve customers successively. Also, each server serves independently. You are also given an integer `n`, which denotes the number of customers before you. Return the minimum time you have to wait before you get served. 

Solution

- Minheap. Every time a customer get served, we pop and then push (end_time, time[i]) into the min heap: O(nlogm) & S(n)
- Binary search. Similar to 1.: O(mlogn) & S(1)
