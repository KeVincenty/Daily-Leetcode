# 1. You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip. Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus. You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips. https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/

Solution

- Binary search: O(mlogn) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int t: time) {
            min = Math.min(min, t);
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = totalTrips * min;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            int cur = 0;
            for (int t: time) {
                cur += mid / t;
            }
            if (cur >= totalTrips) {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        # calculate the upper bound of time
        min_time = time[0]
        for t in time:
            min_time = min(t, min_time)
        right = totalTrips*min_time
        # binary search the minimum time in which at most totalTrips trips can be completed
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # calculate the number of trips at most can be completed using mid time
            num = 0
            for t in time:
                num += mid//t
            if num >= totalTrips:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

# 2. You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the i-th server to serve one customer. There are `m` servers in total. Each server can serve customers successively. Also, each server serves independently. You are also given an integer `n`, which denotes the number of customers before you. Return the minimum time you have to wait before you get served. 

Solution

- Minheap. Every time a customer get served, we pop and then push (end_time, time[i]) into the min heap: O(nlogm) & S(n)
- Binary search. Similar to 1.: O(mlogn) & S(1)

Code

- Java (Minheap)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minWaitingTime(int[] times, int totalCus) {
        if (totalCus <= times.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minheap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (a[0] - b[0]));
        for (int i = 0; i < totalCus; i++) {
            if (i < times.length){
                minheap.add(new int[]{times[i], times[i]});
            }
            else {
                int[] top = minheap.poll();
                top[0] += top[1];
                minheap.add(top);
            }
        }
        return  minheap.peek()[0];
    }
}
```

- Python (Binary search)

```python
class Solution:
    def minWaitingTime(self, times: List[int], totalCus: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        # calculate the upper bound of time
        min_time = times[0]
        for t in times:
            min_time = min(t, min_time)
        right = totalTrips*min_time
        # binary search the minimum time in which at most totalTrips trips can be completed
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # calculate the number of trips at most can be completed using mid time
            num = 0
            for t in times:
                num += mid//t + 1
            if num > totalTrips:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
