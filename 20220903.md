# 1. Return all non-negative integers of length `n` such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `k` (without leading `0`). https://leetcode.com/problems/numbers-with-same-consecutive-differences/

Solution

- BFS/DFS: O(2^n) & S(1)

Code

- Java (BFS)

```java

```

- Python (DFS/Backtracking)

```python
class Solution:
    def numsSameConsecDiff(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        self.res = []
        self.numsSameConsecDiffCore(n, k, 0, 0)
        return self.res
        
    def numsSameConsecDiffCore(self, n, k, curN, curInt):
        if curN == n:
            self.res.append(curInt)
            return
        for i in range(10):
            if (curN == 0 and i != 0) or (curN > 0 and abs(curInt % 10 - i) == k):
                curInt = curInt * 10 + i
                curN += 1
                self.numsSameConsecDiffCore(n, k, curN, curInt)
                curInt = curInt // 10
                curN -= 1
