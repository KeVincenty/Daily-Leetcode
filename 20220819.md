# 1. You are given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order. Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true: 1) Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer). 2) All subsequences have a length of 3 or more. Return `true` if you can split `nums` according to the above conditions, or `false` otherwise. https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/

    def isPossible(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        appendFreq = {}
        
        for num in nums:
            if freq[num] == 0:
                continue
            elif appendFreq.get(num, 0) > 0: # check if num can be appended to the previous subsequence
                appendFreq[num] -= 1 #append
                appendFreq[num+1] = appendFreq.get(num+1, 0) + 1 # this step is to indicate that when we meet num+1 in nums later, we could append it to this subsequence
            elif freq.get(num+1, 0) > 0 and freq.get(num+2, 0) > 0: # check if num can start a new subsequence
                freq[num+1] -= 1 #append
                freq[num+2] -= 1 #append
                appendFreq[num+3] = appendFreq.get(num+3, 0) + 1 # this step is to indicate that when we meet num+3 in nums later, we could append it to this subsequence
            else: # if both two previous condictions do not apply, return false
                return False 
            freq[num] -= 1 #append
