# 1. Remove the k-th node from the end of a given linked list https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/ 剑指offer 22

Solution

- Two pointers, 1st one moves k nodes ahead the 2nd one. When 1st one reaches the end, the 2nd one is at k-th node from the end: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        fast = head
        step = n - 1
        while step > 0:
            fast = fast.next
            step -= 1
        slow = head
        prev = None
        while fast.next is not None:
            fast = fast.next
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
        if prev is not None:
            prev.next = slow.next
        else:
            head = head.next
        return head

# 2. Given two singly linked-lists, return the first node at which the two linked lists intersect https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/ 剑指offer 52

Solution

- Two pointers, similar to 1. If the two linked list have intersection, then the difference of the indexes of the intersection nodes in both linked list equals to the difference of the length of both linked list: O(m+n) & S(1)
- From another perspective, if we do not want to calculate the length, we can let both pointers traverse each linked list once. In this case, both pointers will go (m+n) steps and reach the intersection node (or the None if there is no intersection) at the same time: O(m+n) & S(1)

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python 1 (Calculate the length)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pA = headA
        pB = headB
        lenA = 0
        lenB = 0
        while pA is not None:
            pA = pA.next
            lenA += 1
        while pB is not None:
            pB = pB.next
            lenB += 1
        pA = headA
        pB = headB
        if lenA >= lenB:
            step = lenA - lenB
            while step > 0:
                pA = pA.next
                step -= 1
        else:
            step = lenB - lenA
            while step > 0:
                pB = pB.next
                step -= 1
        while pA is not None and pB is not None:
            if pA == pB:
                return pA
            pA = pA.next
            pB = pB.next
        return None
```

- Python 2 (NOT calculate the length)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        p1 = headA
        p2 = headB
        
        while p1 != p2:
            p1 = p1.next if p1 is not None else headB
            p2 = p2.next if p2 is not None else headA
        
        return p1
