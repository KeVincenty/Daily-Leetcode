# 1. Given a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list". The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always `null`. The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree. https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/

Solution

- Iteratively and recursively: O(n) & S(1)

Code

- Java (Iterative)

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        // iteratively traverse each node and assign its right subtree as the right node of the right-most node in its left subtree
        TreeNode cur = root;
        while (cur != null) {
            if (cur.left != null) {
            TreeNode tail = cur.left;
            while (tail != null && tail.right != null) {
                tail = tail.right;
            }
            tail.right = cur.right;
            cur.right = cur.left;
            cur.left = null;
            }
            cur = cur.right;
        }
    }
}
```

- Python (Recursive)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    prev = None
    
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        if root is None:
            return
        self.flatten(root.right)
        self.flatten(root.left)
        root.right = self.prev
        root.left = None
        self.prev = root
