# 1. A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position. There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array `stations` where `stations[i] = [positioni, fueli]` indicates that the `ith` gas station is `positioni` miles east of the starting position and has `fueli` liters of gas. The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car. Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`. https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/

Solution

- DP: O(n^2) & S(n)

Code

- Java (2D-DP)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, int[][] stations) {
        if (startFuel >= target) {
            return 0;
        }
        int n = stations.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][n+1]; // dp[i][j]: in former i stations, pick j stations to fuel, the farthest position the car can reach
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = startFuel;
        }
        for (int col = 1; col < n + 1; col++) {
            for (int row = col; row < n + 1; row++) {
                dp[row][col] = dp[row-1][col];
                if (dp[row-1][col-1] >= stations[row-1][0]) {
                    dp[row][col] = Math.max(dp[row][col], dp[row-1][col-1] + stations[row-1][1]);
                }
                if (dp[row][col] >= target) {
                    return col;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

```java

            return 0;

        Arrays.fill(dp[0], startFuel);
        for (int col = 1; col < n + 1; col++) {
            int cur = col & 1;
            for (int row = col; row < n + 1; row++) {
                dp[cur][row] = dp[cur][row-1];x
                if (dp[1-cur][row-1] >= stations[row-1][0]) {
                    dp[cur][row] = Math.max(dp[cur][row], dp[1-cur][row-1] + stations[row-1][1]);
                }

                    return col;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
