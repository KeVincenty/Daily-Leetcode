        n2 = float('-inf') # use n3 to mark current '2' in '132' pattern
        stack = [] # use a stack to track current '3' in '132' pattern
        for n1 in reversed(nums): # iterate through candidate '1' in '132' pattern
            if n1 < n2: # after pop and append, n2 and the top of the stack will form '32' in '132', then we only need to find a valid '1'
