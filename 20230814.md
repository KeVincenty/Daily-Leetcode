class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        n, m = len(s), len(t)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] # dp[i][j] is the answer for s[:i] and t[:j]. Can be optimized to S(m) implementation
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(m+1):
