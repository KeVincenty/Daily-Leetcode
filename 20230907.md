- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAlternatingSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        even, odd = 0, 0 # even is the maximum alternating sum when the current element is the last element in the subsequence and it is on the even position; odd is ... on the odd position
        for i in range(n):
            even, odd = max(even, odd + nums[i]), max(odd, even - nums[i])
        return even
