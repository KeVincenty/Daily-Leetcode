- DP: O(nm) & S(min(n,m))

Code

- Java

```java

```

- Python

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)] # can be modified to a S(min(n,m)) implementation
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if text1[i] == text2[j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])
        return dp[-1][-1]
